# Option Pricing Engine (Python)

The Option Pricing Engine is an advanced Python project that allows users to calculate the prices of European call and put options using both the Black-Scholes formula and Monte Carlo simulations. This project provides a practical introduction to quantitative finance concepts, combining mathematical modeling, stochastic simulations, and risk metrics in a single, easy-to-understand Python file. By implementing both deterministic and probabilistic methods, it gives users a comprehensive view of option pricing and the factors that affect market risk.

The project enables users to define an option’s characteristics, including the underlying asset price, strike price, time to maturity, risk-free rate, and volatility. Using the Black-Scholes formula, it computes the theoretical option price and key risk metrics, known as Greeks, such as Delta and Gamma. Monte Carlo simulations provide an alternative, stochastic approach by modeling the possible future paths of the underlying asset’s price, offering insight into the distribution of potential outcomes and helping to visualize uncertainty in option pricing.

Designed entirely with the Python standard library, the Option Pricing Engine is accessible, lightweight, and suitable for learners, students, and Hacktoberfest contributors who want to explore financial modeling and quantitative analysis. Users can experiment with different option parameters, simulation counts, and market conditions to observe how these factors impact pricing and risk measures. The combination of formula-based and simulation-based methods demonstrates the flexibility and power of Python in modeling complex financial instruments.

Beyond educational purposes, this project serves as a foundation for more sophisticated financial applications, such as portfolio hedging, risk management, or derivative pricing engines. By bridging theoretical finance concepts with practical Python implementation, the Option Pricing Engine encourages experimentation, learning, and contribution. It provides a robust, single-file tool for anyone interested in exploring quantitative finance, financial engineering, or algorithmic trading strategies.
